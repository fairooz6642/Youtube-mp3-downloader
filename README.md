# Youtube-mp3-downloader
This is a web application to convert Youtube links to mp4 or mp3 formats and downloading them. Four popular regional Youtube videos are shown, whole link you can drag and drop on the conversion text-box. Some videos are not displayed, which is again due to Youtube's regional settings or privacy of certain channels. The back-end is still under development. There still exists the hassle of using an Youtube-api key.
